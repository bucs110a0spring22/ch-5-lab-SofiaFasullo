## SUMMARY:
My program creates a "dartboard" (2x2 square, circle with radius 1 inside square, axis lines), and then throws darts randomly within the square. A game of 10 dart throws alternating between 2 players is played and then the winner is announced, their points counted for every dart that hits the circle. Then a function estimates pi by multiplying the proportion of "scores" from an arbitrary number of dart throws by 4.
Midterm: I added a function that throws darts until they hit the bullseye, and counts how many tries it takes. I also cleaned up the code.
